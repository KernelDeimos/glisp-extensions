# Glisp Extensions

Extensions for the repository at `https://github.com/zhemao/glisp`.

Glisp appears to no longer be actively maintained. Fortauntely, due to its
extensibility, simplicity, and lack of dependancies, I've been able to get by
using an extension package I've created rather than maintaining a fork.

I'm very tempted to create a new package similar to Glisp, as I have some
interesting ideas such as using a code generator to make all of Go's standard
library available from Glisp scripts. If I find the time to create such a thing
I'll post an update in this README file.

This package is released under the MIT license. Feel free to post an issue if
for any reason you need the package under a different license.
